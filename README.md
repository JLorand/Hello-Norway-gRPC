# Hello-Norway-gRPC

This is a kind of Hello World level project. :)
The idea was to learn about gRPC along with .NET 6 meanwhile pactising some dotnet and git commands within VS Code terminal.
In the future, I'm planning to create a containerized (Docker) .NET 6 applications using gRPC for API gateway communication between the client and the microservices.
